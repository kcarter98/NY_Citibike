# NY_Citibike

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, the data for NYC Citibike was used to create visulaizations that showed metrics, such as:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The peak times for bike trips.
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

Please view the Tableau Story below for the results of the analysis.

## Summary

From the results, some key metrics that stood out were how long riders took their rides, where most of the rides began, the times of day and weekday that riders of both genders and usertypes were most active.

Riders of all types seemed to take rides that lasted at least 5 minutes, but usually no longer than 30 minutes with most rides starting in lower manhattan likely due to tourism. Additionally, riders of all types seemed to use the bikes between 7 am and 8 pm with the peak times around 5 pm and 6 pm. Another additional note would be to mention that due to the imbalance of male to female data, the overall data might be a bit biased and not represent each population, so looking at the data by gender is another approach.

So when it comes to gender, males tended to take more rides on the weekdays at around 8 am and again around 5-6 pm. These times seem to correlate with when one would go to and from work, and additionally the majority of subscribed customers are men which hints at repeated use and likely means that this is a mode of transportation to and from work for most men. Females, seem to have higher usage rates on the weekends during midday. Additionally, most of the normal customers are females, so this hints at a more spontaneous usage of the ride sharing system compared to males. 

Lastly, two additional visualizations I would recommend for future analysis would be to show peak months of the year when the ride sharing system is used. Additionally I would like to go further into the behavior of different usertypes, like the times of day each one rides and how often the service is utilized by each.
